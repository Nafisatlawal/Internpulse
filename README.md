# E-Commerce Store Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on an e-commerce store's data to uncover trends and patterns in customer behavior, purchasing habits, marketing impact, pricing effectiveness, and product quality. The insights derived will inform strategic recommendations to improve business operations, customer retention, and profitability.

## Data Source
The dataset consists of historical transaction records from the e-commerce store, including:

- Customer Demographics: Age, income level, and satisfaction scores.

- Purchase Information: Purchase amount, product category, and return rate.

- Marketing Data: Social media influence scores and engagement metrics.

- Shipping Preferences: Shipping methods selected per purchase.

- Discount Usage: Discount sensitivity and impact on returns.

## Tools Used

1. Microsoft Excel:
- For data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.
- Created calculated columns, Pivot Tables, and charts.
2. Data Visualization:
- Bar charts, stacked column charts, scatter plots, and line graphs were used to illustrate insights.
Markdown Documentation:
- Used GitHub-friendly Markdown for this project report.

# Deliverables

1. Interactive Dashboard:
- Includes all visualizations (spending trends, return rates, discounts, etc.).
2. Documentation:
  - Comprehensive analysis steps, findings, and recommendations (as listed above).

   # Recommendations

- Improve quality control and set clear expectations for high-return categories.
- Focus customer service efforts on dissatisfied customers to prevent returns.
- Analyze why low-rated products show lower-than-expected returns to refine product offerings.
